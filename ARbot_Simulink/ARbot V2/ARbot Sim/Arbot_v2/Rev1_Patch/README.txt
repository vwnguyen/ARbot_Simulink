This patch is for Rev 1 version of the mechanical design.
In order to apply the patch perform the following: 
1. Replace your existing description folder with the one here.
2. Add ARbot_v1 and all subfolders to your path
3. Run the ARbot_Rev1.slx file to check if the .stl mesh files are working properly.

Contents:
The description folder has the Rev1 urdf files.
The .slx files contains the updated ARbot Plant model

Notes:
The same start up script will work from before but this time make all of the angles positive and the robot will behave as expected.
